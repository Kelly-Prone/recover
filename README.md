# recover
This is the resolution for exercise "recover" for week 4 of the CS50 Harvard course. The idea of this exercise is to write a program that iterates over a copy of my memory card, looking for JPEG signatures. Every time I find a signature, we open a new file to write and start filling that file with bytes from my memory card, closing that file only when I find another signature.
